Description: A package for the temporal refinement of endometrial biopsies using an initial
    timing value as provided via urinary ovulation test and the measurement of expression for
    a panel of time-sensitive genes. Additionally, EndoTime allows for the quantification of
    sample 'asynchrony', a value which describes the conformity between the timing estimates
    provided on a per-gene basis.
